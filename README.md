# Dewey List

## Overview

For WDI project #5, I created a web application called Dewey List. Dewey List allows users to subscribe to curated book lists. Book lists are curated by influencers or organizations with a cause. A portion of proceeds from each book sale goes to support a charitable organization of the curatorâ€™s choice.

Users can create an account and log in. The user can then view a list of all book lists, as well as list-specific details. The user can subscribe and unsubscribe from lists. If the user is assigned a role of curator, she can create, update, and delete lists.

**Live site:** https://www.deweylist.com/
